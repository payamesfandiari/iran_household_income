Iranian Open Data Project
==========================

This project is intended as a ground work for a Data Exploration/Data Analysis website of Iranian Center of Statistics. 
This project is not supported by any entity of Iranian government. Rather it's an effort by a group of Iranian intellectuals in hopes of 
cementing a ground work for other researchers and intellectuals in hopes of better futures.
